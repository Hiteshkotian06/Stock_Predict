# Stock Prediction Project

In this project, I developed a stock price prediction model for Reliance Industries using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The model was built with TensorFlow and Keras, leveraging historical stock price data to predict future prices. \
It involved - 
Data Preprocessing \
Model Architecture \
Training and Evaluation \
The performance metrics of this models is - \
Train data RMSE:  64.78914132700173 \
Test data RMSE:  76.30738761946796 \
Train data MSE:  4197.632833890203 \
Test data MSE:  5822.817405307733 \
Test data MAE:  36.34497755647808 \
Test data MAE:  53.694011671935144 \
Train data R2 score: 0.9856074221791715 \
Test data R2 score: 0.9869894108882624
